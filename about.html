            <div class="col-span-full m-col-start-1 m-col-end-8">
            <p>Zima was a brand initially started in 1993, a drink that was quickly forgotten in the eyes of the public due to criticisms about being “boring” and “unmanly”, but in recent times, Zima has gotten the rebrand it needed!</p><p>Zima had tried in the past to revive itself, but only for limited time releases and minor brand deals in Japan.</p><p>Zima is a resurrected drink, with a fresh new look and a fresh new formula, no longer associated with one specific gender or crowd but a fun wine cooler for all! </p>

            <p class="col-span-full m-col-span-full middle-paragraph">In the new generation of Zima, our wonderful company has decided to make the irresistible flavours of Zima taste even more fresh, made our branding even more eye-catching, and expanded our target demographic. This new era of Zima hopes to usher in a new wave of popularity for the brand, so that our dear customers can enjoy Zima for years to come.</p>

            <p>As a part of Zima&apos;s new face, we have also changed the way we make our alcohol. We&apos;ve upgraded from 5% to 7% alcohol content in each bottle or can of Zima, resulting in a delicious and strong beverage to mix in with other drinks or enjoy on your own.</p><p>The citrus theme of Zima is our staple, and we are committed to coming up with fun, fresh new flavours as our brand grows.

            <p class="col-span-full m-col-span-full middle-paragraph">Zima&apos;s rebrand has come with many more changes beyond appeal, branding, and formula. As of 2026, Zima has partnered with many recycling facilities and professionals to create a bottle and label that are completely recyclable. With this new model, Zima is committing to reducing our carbon footprint by up to 60%!</p>
